Additionally, they can assign and grade assignments, and engage in discussions about the grading criteria. The platform also features quizzes that are automatically graded for enhanced learning assessment.

Both students and teachers receive real-time push notifications, ensuring they stay informed about important updates, such as comments on assignments or grading results. This helps keep everyone engaged and up-to-date with key events.

## Tech

The frontend is developed in the [Angular 10](https://v10.angular.io/docs) framework combined with [Ionic 5](https://ionic-docs-5utg8ms4c-ionic1.vercel.app/docs/v5) to make the platform accessible as a web application and a native mobile application from a single codebase.

There is also some Firebase integration for push-notification management.
